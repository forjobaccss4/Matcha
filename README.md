<b>Web Matcha project</b>

<b>Web App with the following features:</b><br>
<ul><b>Registration and Signing-in:</b><br>
<li>The app allow a user to register asking at least an email address, a username, a last
name, a first name and a protected password.</li>
<li>After the registration, an
e-mail with an unique link will be sent to the registered user to verify his account.</li>
<li>The user is able to connect with his/her username and password. </li>
<li>He/She is able to receive an email allowing him/her to re-initialize his/her password.</li>
</ul>

<ul><b>IV.3 Browsing:</b><br>
<li>I propose only “interesting” profiles for example, only men for a heterosexual
girls. I manage bisexuality. If the orientation isn’t specified, the user will
be considered bi-sexual.</li>
<ul> Profiles are cleverly matched:
<li> Same geographic area as the user.</li>
<li> With a maximum of common tags.</li>
<li> With a maximum “fame rating”.</li>
<li> You must show in priority people from the same geographical area.</li>
<li> The list must be sortable by age, localization, “fame rating” and common tags.</li>
<li> The list must be filterable by age, localization, “fame rating” and common tags.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
